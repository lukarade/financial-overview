# Financial Overview
# Summary
This project is a financial overview application that allows users to track their income and expenses. The application consists of several components that display the financial data in different ways. The main components are the calendar component, the overview component, the list component, and the financial flow component. The calendar component displays the current month and year and allows users to add, edit, and delete events. The overview component displays the total income and expenses for the current year/month/week/day and a pie chart that shows the percentage of income and expenses for the current month. The list component displays all the income and expenses for the current year/month/week/day. The financial flow component displays the percentage of capital flow from all income to all expenses for the current year/month/week/day. Each category is represented by a different color, and the categories are sorted by the amount of money spent on them. The categories are clickable to display the events that belong to them and are highlighted when hovered over.

Below is a list of the features that need to be implemented for each component.
